This is an interactive project that shows how TCP protocols like SSH and blockchain encrypt and decrypt their messages using RSA technology. 

It uses a random passphrase to generate a public and private key. The public key is visible to the client, but the private key is kept on the side of the secure data. 

This program shows how people can use public keys to access data while not having access to the private key (kind of like a lockbox or bank where anything you put inside is locked into a smaller chamber where you're not authorized).
